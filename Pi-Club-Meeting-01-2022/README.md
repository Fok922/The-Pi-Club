You may have discovered that all files with .py extension do not 
have a download button.

So, how do I download python files from a GitHub repository?

On github, open the python file you want to download, by clicking its link.
Once opened, locate the "Raw" button adjacent to the "Blame" button.
Press "Alt" on your keyboard and left-click on your mouse on the Raw Button at the same time.
The file will download automatically to your default download folder
